# Penguins Data Modeling and Analysis
 This project explores statistical modeling techniques, including simple and multiple linear regression and K-means clustering, using Python. It applies exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and statistical modeling with pandas, NumPy, statsmodels, and scikit-learn. The regression models analyze relationships within the dataset, while K-means clustering segments data to identify patterns. Visualizations are created using Seaborn to enhance interpretability.
